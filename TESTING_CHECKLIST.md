## üìù Quick Test Script

Run these commands to verify basic functionality:

```bash
# 1. Check for TypeScript errors
npm run build

# 2. Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# 3. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 4. Open React Query DevTools
# Look for the React Query icon in bottom-left corner
# Verify queries are running and caching correctly
```

---

5. [x] Data persists correctly to database
6. [x] No TypeScript or build errors

---

## üìä React Query DevTools Usage

1. **Access DevTools**: Look for React Query logo in bottom-left corner (dev mode only)
2. **Check Queries**: Click to see all active queries
3. **Check Mutations**: View recent mutations and their status
4. **Monitor Cache**: Verify query keys and cached data
5. **Test Refetching**: Use "Invalidate" buttons to test cache invalidation

## üéØ Post-Migration Checklist (After Clerk)

## üí° Tips

- Test in an **incognito/private window** to avoid cached sessions
- Clear browser cache between major test runs
- Use **React Query DevTools** to monitor query behavior
- Check **browser console** for any errors
- Check **Network tab** to verify API calls
- Test with **different user accounts** if possible
